# Third-party notices

MailMeUp source is MIT-licensed. Dependencies retain their own licenses; MailMeUp's license does not replace them.

The exact restored CLI dependency inventory is in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` in source and `DEPENDENCIES.md` in portable packages. `scripts/export-notices.py` derives it from NuGet metadata and fails validation if it becomes stale.

Included upstream license texts under `docs/licenses/` (or `licenses/` in a portable package) cover:

- .NET runtime and Microsoft packages: MIT, with upstream third-party notices.
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI: MIT.
- ModelContextProtocol: Apache-2.0.
- Spectre.Console: MIT.
- Serilog and its hosting, logging and console integrations: Apache-2.0.
- SQLitePCLRaw: Apache-2.0; its bundled SQLite engine has separate public-domain provenance described by that upstream project.

Portable packaging also copies each restored package's `.nuspec` and available license/notice files, preserving package-specific metadata and notices. Test dependencies are development-only and are not distributed with the executable. Review new dependency licenses and notices when updating packages.
