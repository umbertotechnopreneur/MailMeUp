# Brand guide

## Identity

Name: **MailMeUp**. Preserve capitalization; do not use spaces in the product name. Executable and MCP server identifier: `mailmeup`.

Tagline: **All your inboxes. One conversation.**

One-line description: **A local email bridge that brings multiple accounts into your AI conversation.**

Expanded product description: **Email and calendars from multiple accounts, available through one local MCP bridge.**

The identity shares the practical, personal naming rhythm of PromptMeUp and TrackMeUp. The visual idea is convergence: several envelopes become one useful conversation.

## Visual vocabulary

Use restrained dimensional envelopes, generous empty space and clear connection lines. The hero uses an editorial serif wordmark with simple supporting typography. Keep diagrams and code documentation highly legible. A geometric envelope SVG is provided for compact technical uses; generated illustrations are conceptual artwork rather than the canonical icon source.

Asset type: wide product banner for the English-only MailMeUp Windows desktop app About & Support dialog.
Primary request: Create a polished premium digital illustration that expresses multiple email inboxes and calendars coming together in one helpful AI conversation.
Scene/backdrop: deep midnight navy #071525, smooth subtle atmospheric gradient, no frame, a quiet refined desktop-app aesthetic.
Subject: on the center-right, three small dimensional ivory envelopes and one minimal ivory calendar card flowing along delicate mint connection curves into one larger rounded mint conversation bubble, with a subtle small coral accent. The cards should feel clean, friendly and tactile, like softly beveled paper objects, with crisp edge highlights and restrained natural shadows. Calendar has only a small grid of blank rounded cells, no dates or letters. Conversation bubble has three ivory dots, no robot face. Avoid arrows implying email sending; flowing undirected lines express reading and gathering.
Composition/framing: panoramic 3:1 landscape image, ideally 1536 by 512. Left 38 percent remains calm midnight negative space for a native title overlay, while illustration occupies center-right. Keep all objects comfortably inside image safe margins. Sophisticated spacious composition, readable at 600 by 200 pixels.
Lighting/mood: soft studio illumination, subtle mint glow, welcoming trustworthy calm, high quality dimensional illustration.
Color palette: midnight #071525, mint #71DEB7, warm ivory #F5EADB, coral #FF8F79, quiet slate #6E879E.
Constraints: original standalone artwork. No text, letters, words, logos, vendor marks, GitHub marks, watermark, borders, screenshots, button shapes, padlocks or shields. No busy particles, no people. The image must look finished without text.
